## Common errors and how to fix them:
----------------------------------------------

- **Error:** *_Missing DLL files or any files_*
- **Solution:** Your antivirus has detected WeAreDevs_API.dll or any file that it creates as a threat, disable your antivirus and redownload the executor (always have it disabled when using the executor)


- **Error:** *_You are using an outdated version of the WeAreDevs API_*
- **Solution:** Close the executor then delete finj.exe and restart the executor, if that doesnt work redownload the executor on the latest version
